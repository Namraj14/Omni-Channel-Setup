# Presence Configuration Setup Explanation

Presence Configurations define how agents interact with Omni-Channel, including their capacity to handle work, behavior on accepting/declining work, and notification settings.

---

## What is Presence Configuration?

Presence Configuration controls:

- **How much work** an agent can handle at once (capacity).
- Whether agents can **automatically accept** or **decline** work.
- How the system **notifies agents** about incoming work.
- What **wrap-up time** agents get after finishing work.
- Settings for **transferring** work to other agents or queues.

(It controls how much work an agent can handle at a time, what types of work they can receive, and how they interact with incoming work.)

🔍 In Simple Terms:
It sets the capacity for agents (how many cases/chats/tasks they can work on simultaneously).
It groups Presence Statuses (like Available, Busy, Offline) to control agent availability.
It controls notifications and settings for work assignment behavior (e.g., can agents decline work? do they get notified with sounds?).

| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Presence Configuration** | Defines max capacity and availability statuses for agents                      |
| **Presence Status**        | The different states an agent can set (Available, Busy, Offline)               |
| **Agents**                 | Assigned to Presence Configuration to get their work limits and status options |
| **Omni-Channel Widget**    | Agents use this to set their status and accept work                            |


## Fields and Explanation

### Presence Configuration Name  
- **What:** The display name of the configuration.  
- **Why:** To identify the configuration among multiple ones.  
- **Example:** `"miaw"`

### Developer Name  
- **What:** The API name for the configuration.  
- **Why:** Used for programmatic reference.  
- **Example:** `"miaw"`

### Capacity  
- **What:** Maximum units of work an agent can handle simultaneously.  
- **Why:** Controls workload per agent to avoid overloading.  
- **Example:** `20` means agent can handle 20 units of work total.

### Interruptible Capacity  
- **What:** Portion of the capacity that can be interrupted by higher-priority work.  
- **Why:** Allows urgent tasks to preempt less critical ones within this capacity.  
- **Example:** If set to 5, up to 5 units of ongoing work can be interrupted.

### Automatically accept work requests  
- **What:** If enabled, agents automatically accept incoming work without manual action.  
- **Why:** Speeds up processing, useful for high-volume scenarios.  
- **Example:** In a busy call center, agents get work assigned instantly.

### Allow agents to decline work requests  
- **What:** If enabled, agents can reject work assignments.  
- **Why:** Gives agents control to refuse tasks they can’t handle.  
- **Example:** Agent can decline if busy or not skilled for a task.

### Update Status on Decline  
- **What:** Status the agent is switched to when declining work.  
- **Why:** Keeps presence status accurate (e.g., sets agent to “Busy”).  
- **Example:** Agent status changes to "Offline" after declining.

### Allow agents to choose a decline reason  
- **What:** Lets agents specify why they declined a work item.  
- **Why:** Helps managers track and analyze declined work patterns.  
- **Example:** Reasons could be “Not skilled”, “Too busy”, or “Out of office.”

### Update Status on Push Timeout  
- **What:** Status agent switches to if they don’t respond to a work push in time.  
- **Why:** Ensures agents who miss work assignments don’t stay “Available.”  
- **Example:** Agent moved to “Away” after ignoring work assignment.

### Play a notification sound for work requests  
- **What:** Enables sound alerts for new work assignments.  
- **Why:** Notifies agents actively when new work arrives.  
- **Example:** A chime or beep when a new chat or case arrives.

### Notification Sound  
- **What:** Choose default or custom sound for notifications.  
- **Why:** Customize sounds to fit your team’s preferences.  
- **Example:** Custom sound with company branding.

### Sound Length (Seconds)  
- **What:** Duration of the notification sound, max 30 seconds.  
- **Why:** Controls how long the alert plays.  
- **Example:** Set to 5 seconds to avoid long distractions.

### Play a notification sound if Omni-Channel loses connection  
- **What:** Sound alert if Omni-Channel disconnects.  
- **Why:** Notifies agents to check connectivity issues.  
- **Example:** Warning beep if internet drops.

### After Conversation Work Time  
- **What:** Wrap-up time given to agents after finishing a task.  
- **Why:** Allows agents to complete notes or prepare before next work.  
- **Example:** 2 minutes to finalize case details.

### Agent Alias (Enhanced Messaging Only)  
- **What:** Custom alias agents use in enhanced messaging interactions.  
- **Why:** Masks real agent name, for privacy or branding.  
- **Example:** Alias like "Support Agent 01".

### Transfer Destinations  
- **What:** Defines where agents can transfer messaging sessions (profiles, queues, flows).  
- **Why:** Controls transfer targets to ensure proper routing and permissions.  
- **Example:** Agents can transfer to “Tier 2 Support” queue or specific flows.

## Why configure Presence Configuration?

- Without it, agents won’t know how much work they can handle.
- Routing may send too much work to agents, causing overload.
- Agents won’t have proper status updates, leading to poor workload tracking.
- Notifications won’t function, so agents may miss work assignments.
- No wrap-up time can cause rushed or incomplete task handling.

## How it fits in Omni-Channel flow

1. **Service Channel** monitors work from objects like Cases.
2. **Queues** hold records waiting for agents.
3. **Routing Configurations** define how work moves from queues to agents.
4. **Presence Configuration** defines agents’ capacity and behavior for accepting/declining work.
5. **Agents** assigned to a Presence Configuration see their capacity and statuses in the Omni-Channel widget.
