# Salesforce Omni-Channel

## Definition

**Omni-Channel** is a **Salesforce Service Cloud feature** that intelligently routes work items (such as Cases, Chats, Leads, or custom objects) to the **right agents** in real-time based on their availability, skill set, and workload.

## Overview

Omni-Channel ensures that:
- The **right agent** gets the **right work**, at the **right time**.
- It prevents agents from being overwhelmed.
- It supports multiple channels like **Chat, Email, Web, Phone, and Social Media**, hence the name **Omni** (meaning all).

## Key Features

| Feature              | Description                                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Work Routing**     | Routes records (Cases, Leads, etc.) to agents automatically. |
| **Routing Configurations** | Define how work is prioritized and assigned.             |
| **Presence Status**   | Agents can set themselves as available/unavailable for different types of work. |
| **Skills-Based Routing** | Matches work with agents based on skill sets.             |
| **Push vs. Pull**    | Pushes work to agents (versus agents picking work from queues). |

## Example Use Case

1. A new **Case** is created from email.
2. Omni-Channel checks which agent is **available** and has the right **skills**.
3. It **automatically assigns** the case to that agent and **notifies** them in the console.
4. The agent accepts and starts working immediately.

## Objects Omni-Channel Can Route

- **Standard**: Cases, Leads, Chats, SOS Sessions
- **Custom**: Any custom object (e.g., `Work_Order__c`)

## Benefits

- Faster customer service.
- Balanced agent workload.
- Increased productivity.
